## Regarding complexity of is_subset function. 

#### * validation of IntSet input array is linear sequential check - O(n) complexity.
#### * validation is a bottleneck for construction of set from array.
#### * While construction of set is first part of the is_subset functionality the actual check for subset is done by checking for each elements existance in the first array. If the second array has k elements then the worst case check is O(k) complexity.

## Regarding the article I read recently.
